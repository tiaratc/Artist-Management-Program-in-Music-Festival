This project is to create a Python program made to help organize and manage artistâ€™s schedule in a music festival. The program lets users add, view, update, delete, and check potential conflicts in show schedules. 

It is based on real challenges I faced while managing events with many performances, which doing the above manually takes a significant amount of time.

This program will help speed up the manual process of checking every artists and group members, while also making sure all of them are not scheduled for shows that happen at the same time.

## Features

	1.	Login: The app has two roles: Admin and Regular. Admins require password, while Regular users don't need a password and can be accessed by anyone with the program.
	2.	Add Show
		Users can add new shows with information like the group name, members, day, time, and hall. The program checks for duplicates and ensures the input is correct (e.g., time format).
	3.	View Shows
		Users can see all shows or filter them by group name, day, or hall. 
	4.	Update Show
		Users can change the details of a show, such as the group name, members, day, time, and hall.
	5.	Delete Show
		Users can remove a show by its Contract ID. The program asks for confirmation to make sure the deletion is intentional.
	6.	Check for Conflicts
		The program checks if any group or member has overlapping shows at the same time. This helps avoid scheduling problems.
  	7. 	Sort 
   		Table information displayed already sorted based on group name or time of shows for easy reading.
